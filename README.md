# Daily DevOps & .NET

This is where we share code, scripts, and articles from [daily-devops.net](https://daily-devops.net/). Mostly stuff we've figured out while working with .NET and DevOps in production.

We focus on practical solutions: CI/CD pipelines, infrastructure automation, cloud platforms, containerization, and .NET development patterns. Real problems, real solutions.

## What's Here

- **Articles** - Guides and writeups on DevOps, cloud (Azure, AWS), infrastructure as code, and .NET
- **Code Examples** - Scripts and samples in C#, PowerShell, Docker, Kubernetes, and related tools
- **Templates** - Configuration files and templates you can use as a starting point
- **Useful Scripts** - Small utilities and automation tools for common tasks

## How to Use This

1. Find what you're looking for by browsing the structure or checking the blog
2. Read the article for context if there is one
