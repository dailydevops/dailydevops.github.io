Welcome to the **Daily DevOps & .NET** repository! This is the source code for our technical blog at [daily-devops.net](https://daily-devops.net/), where we share insights, tutorials, and expertise on DevOps practices, .NET development, cloud computing, and modern software engineering.

## 🚀 What We Cover

### .NET & C# Evolution
Stay updated with the latest .NET releases, features, and improvements. We cover:
- **.NET versioning & releases** - New versions, release cycles, and long-term support timelines
- **C# language features** - String handling (`SearchValues`, `StringValues`), nullability, constant attributes, and modern syntax improvements
- **Performance optimization** - `CompositeFormat` performance boosts, defensive programming patterns, and code profiling
- **.NET tooling** - CLI expansions, autocomplete improvements, and developer workflow enhancements

### Azure & Cloud Architecture
Enterprise cloud patterns and Azure-specific solutions:
- **AKS (Azure Kubernetes Service)** - Network policies, zero-trust security, networking challenges, and best practices
- **Cloud-native development** - Infrastructure as code, deployment automation, and scaling patterns
- **Health checks & monitoring** - Service health verification and system reliability

### DevOps & Automation
Modern DevOps practices and automation strategies:
- **CI/CD pipelines** - Continuous integration and deployment workflows
- **Dependency management** - Centralized NuGet package management, security updates, and Dependabot automation
- **Build automation** - PowerShell scripts, automated testing, and deployment strategies
- **Configuration management** - Error handling, warnings, and environment-specific configurations

### .NET Development Patterns
Proven strategies and architectural approaches:
- **Job scheduling** - Comprehensive series on Hangfire, Quartz.NET, Coravel, NCronJob, TickerQ and comparative analysis
- **Legacy code modernization** - Introducing nullability in existing projects, retiring deprecated frameworks, technical debt management
- **Code quality** - Clean code principles, design patterns, instruction-by-design, and metric configuration
- **Testing strategies** - Testing best practices, pragmatic testing frameworks like TUnit, and avoiding testing pitfalls

### Developer Productivity & Tools
Maximize your development experience:
- **GitHub Copilot** - Leveraging AI assistance effectively, avoiding dependency traps, enhancing coding practices
- **Visual Studio** - IDE features, building inside Visual Studio, and 2026 improvements
- **NuGet ecosystem** - Package management, vulnerability assessment, and staying current with dependencies
- **Microsoft Certifications** - Exam preparation, certification renewal, and professional development tracking

### Software Engineering Best Practices
Foundational principles for sustainable development:
- **Technical debt** - Identifying, measuring, and managing technical debt effectively
- **Code reviews & quality** - Buzzword-driven development vs. pragmatic approaches, code metrics, and quality standards
- **Professional growth** - Industry trends, buzzword evaluation, and real-world development practices
- **Timing & architecture** - When to refactor, how timing impacts technical decisions, and strategic code improvements
