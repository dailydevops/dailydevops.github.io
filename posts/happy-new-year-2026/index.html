My wish: fix the technical debt you&rsquo;ve been promising since 2023. Stop telling yourself it will happen <em>next quarter.</em></p><p>Every January, the same ritual. Sprint planning. Someone mentions that problematic module—you know the one. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll refactor it next quarter,&rdquo; they say. Ticket created. Backlog updated.</p><p>By mid-January, forgotten.</p><p>I&rsquo;ve taught enough .NET courses and consulted with enough teams to know: Everyone has technical debt. The Fortune 500 companies have it. The startups have it. You have it. The difference between teams that succeed in 2026 and teams that burn out isn&rsquo;t whether they have technical debt—it&rsquo;s whether they&rsquo;re honest about it.</p><h2 id="why-next-quarter-never-comes"><a href="/posts/happy-new-year-2026/#why-next-quarter-never-comes" title="Why Next Quarter Never Comes">Why <em>Next Quarter</em> Never Comes</a></h2><p>The pattern is always the same. A feature ships. It works—barely. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll clean this up next quarter,&rdquo; someone says. The team knows it&rsquo;s a lie. Management knows it&rsquo;s a lie. Everyone pretends anyway.</p><p>Why? Because admitting you&rsquo;re building on a foundation of compromises feels like failure. It&rsquo;s not. It&rsquo;s reality. But we&rsquo;d rather maintain the fiction.</p><p>Temporary solutions become permanent infrastructure. That &ldquo;quick integration&rdquo; from 2019 is now mission-critical and touches everything. The developer who wrote it left in 2021. The documentation? Nonexistent.</p><p>This compounds. Every shortcut builds on the previous shortcut. Every &ldquo;we&rsquo;ll fix it later&rdquo; adds to the pile. Fast forward to 2026, and you&rsquo;re spending more time working around bad decisions than you would have spent making good ones.</p><p>Technical debt feels free when you create it. Your sprint metrics look great. You shipped the feature. Everyone&rsquo;s happy.</p><p>Eighteen months later, that code is load-bearing. Developers quit because debugging incomprehensible code is soul-crushing. Your velocity drops. The business wonders why. You can&rsquo;t admit the foundation is crumbling.</p><h2 id="every-january-same-promises"><a href="/posts/happy-new-year-2026/#every-january-same-promises" title="Every January, Same Promises">Every January, Same Promises</a></h2><p>I teach .NET courses for students and apprentices.

You suppress them instead because &ldquo;we&rsquo;ll do it properly in the refactoring.&rdquo;</p><p>This isn&rsquo;t developer failure. It&rsquo;s organizational reality. You can only refactor when the business prioritizes it (rarely happens), you have time between features (almost never), you&rsquo;re not fighting production fires (frequently untrue), and nobody&rsquo;s pressuring you to ship faster (never).</p><p>The system ensures technical debt is always someone else&rsquo;s problem. Always scheduled for later. Later never arrives.</p><h2 id="why-technical-debt-compounds-like-credit-card-interest"><a href="/posts/happy-new-year-2026/#why-technical-debt-compounds-like-credit-card-interest" title="Why Technical Debt Compounds Like Credit Card Interest">Why Technical Debt Compounds Like Credit Card Interest</a></h2><p>Your 2026 codebase reflects every shortcut from 2025. Every "we&rsquo;ll fix it later." Every suppressed warning. Every test you didn&rsquo;t write. Cause and effect.</p><p>Most teams think they&rsquo;re trading speed for quality. That&rsquo;s not even wrong—it&rsquo;s nonsense disguised as pragmatism. You&rsquo;re choosing whether to pay now or pay later with interest. Later always costs more.</p><h3 id="the-cost-nobody-tracks"><a href="/posts/happy-new-year-2026/#the-cost-nobody-tracks" title="The Cost Nobody Tracks">The Cost Nobody Tracks</a></h3><p>Technical debt is a business decision. Treat it like one.</p><p>Writing code fast but wrong costs more than writing it right. The 3 AM production incident. The Friday afternoon rollback. The six hours debugging something that proper async patterns would have prevented.</p><p>These costs don&rsquo;t show up in sprint reports. They show up in exhausted developers, missed deadlines, and customer incidents.</p><p>Features that should take days take weeks because the codebase fights you. Every change risks breaking something unrelated. &ldquo;Just be careful&rdquo; doesn&rsquo;t scale.</p><p>Developers quit. Not because of salary. Because maintaining incomprehensible code destroys your soul. That new hire still lost after six months? Your architecture is the problem.</p><h3 id="what-actually-works-from-15-years-of-watching-teams-fail"><a href="/posts/happy-new-year-2026/#what-actually-works-from-15-years-of-watching-teams-fail" title="What Actually Works (From 15 Years of Watching Teams Fail)">What Actually Works (From 15 Years of Watching Teams Fail)</a></h3><p>Sustainable doesn&rsquo;t mean perfect. It means the codebase doesn&rsquo;t actively fight you.</p><p>Write tests because they save debugging time, not because some &ldquo;best practices&rdquo; document says to. I&rsquo;ve watched developers spend three days tracking down a bug that a 15-line unit test would have caught in three seconds. That&rsquo;s not a best practice—that&rsquo;s basic economics.</p><p>Refactor as you go. Not in some mythical future sprint. When you&rsquo;re in a file and you see garbage code, fix it then. Yes, even if it&rsquo;s &ldquo;out of scope.&rdquo; Especially if it&rsquo;s out of scope. The Boy Scout Rule isn&rsquo;t a suggestion—it&rsquo;s how you avoid code rot.</p><p>Push back on scope creep with data. &ldquo;This will take three days with tests, one day without&rdquo; is a lie everyone tells. It takes three days either way—you&rsquo;re just choosing whether to spend them now or during the 2 AM production incident.</p><p>Your .NET project in 2026 has every tool needed to avoid this. Roslyn analyzers like <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/fundamentals/code-analysis/quality-rules/ca1062" target="_blank" rel="noopener external noreferrer">CA1062</a> catch null reference exceptions before they ship. <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/fundamentals/code-analysis/quality-rules/ca2007" target="_blank" rel="noopener external noreferrer">CA2007</a> prevents ConfigureAwait deadlocks automatically. In my MCT courses, I enable these analyzers on legacy projects. Within hours, they&rsquo;ve found bugs that lived in production for years.</p><p>NUnit&rsquo;s parameterized tests let you cover edge cases in three lines. C# 12&rsquo;s primary constructors eliminate the boilerplate nobody ever tested. .NET 9&rsquo;s performance improvements mean you can write cleaner code that&rsquo;s also faster.</p><p>Tools aren&rsquo;t the problem. You can download Visual Studio 2022, enable all the analyzers, and catch 80% of common bugs before your first commit.</p><p>Discipline is the problem.</p><h2 id="what-2026-actually-offers"><a href="/posts/happy-new-year-2026/#what-2026-actually-offers" title="What 2026 Actually Offers">What 2026 Actually Offers</a></h2><p>2026 isn&rsquo;t special. .NET 9 is mature and stable now—shipped November 2024. C# 13 brought some nice features. The ecosystem keeps improving.</p><p>But here&rsquo;s what matters: The tools to build maintainable software have been available for years. Roslyn analyzers. Testing frameworks. Structured logging. Observability tools. None of this is new.</p><p>The bottleneck was never tooling. It&rsquo;s discipline.</p><p>What makes 2026 different? Nothing, unless you decide it is.</p><p>You can start the year like every other year—good intentions, abandoned by February. Or you can actually change something.</p><p>Not by adopting the newest framework. Not by rewriting everything in the latest architectural pattern. By making the unsexy choice: Fix one thing at a time. Add tests as you go. Enable analyzers. Refactor when you touch code, not &ldquo;next quarter.&rdquo;</p><p>.NET 9&rsquo;s <a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/performance-improvements-in-net-9/" target="_blank" rel="noopener external noreferrer">performance improvements</a> are real—LINQ is faster, JSON serialization allocates less, the JIT is smarter. Migrating from .NET 6 or 8 is straightforward. Most teams can do it in days.</p><p>C# 13&rsquo;s params collections and field keyword are fine. Use them where they help. Ignore them where they don&rsquo;t.</p><p>Azure&rsquo;s container and serverless offerings are stable now. Pick what fits your team&rsquo;s expertise. Ignore what Hacker News says is &ldquo;modern.&rdquo;</p><p>AI integration will be 2026&rsquo;s buzzword. Most will be snake oil. Some—like GitHub Copilot for boilerplate—actually helps. Don&rsquo;t chase hype. Solve real problems.</p><h2 id="code-that-doesnt-wake-you-up-at-3-am"><a href="/posts/happy-new-year-2026/#code-that-doesnt-wake-you-up-at-3-am" title="Code That Doesn&rsquo;t Wake You Up at 3 AM">Code That Doesn&rsquo;t Wake You Up at 3 AM</a></h2><p>Intentional development looks boring.

</span></span></code></pre></div><p>This is production code, adapted from a real order-processing system. Nothing fancy. Dependency injection makes it testable—I can mock <code>IOrderRepository</code> in unit tests. Structured logging means when something breaks at 3 AM, I can find it in Azure Application Insights in thirty seconds instead of thirty minutes. OpenTelemetry gives me distributed traces across services. ConfigureAwait prevents the deadlocks that plagued the previous version.</p><p>It&rsquo;s not clever. It&rsquo;s reliable.
