In reality, it&rsquo;s a social mechanism for enforcing long-term responsibility in shared environments.</p><p>Every household gets assigned a recurring time slot in which it must clean communal areas—stairwells, hallways, sidewalks in front of the building. The scope is clearly defined. The cadence is predictable. The expectation is absolute. What makes this system effective isn&rsquo;t enforcement by authority, but enforcement by culture. Skipping your turn isn&rsquo;t illegal, but it&rsquo;s socially expensive.</p><p>Your neighbors know when it&rsquo;s your week. They notice if the stairs look questionable on Tuesday morning. They&rsquo;ll mention it. Not aggressively—just a casual observation that somehow carries the weight of communal judgment. The enforcement mechanism isn&rsquo;t bureaucratic. It&rsquo;s the quiet awareness that someone is watching, and someone remembers.</p><p>This isn&rsquo;t surveillance in the oppressive sense. It&rsquo;s accountability baked into the social contract. You&rsquo;re not cleaning because Big Brother demands it. You&rsquo;re cleaning because Mrs. Schmid from the second floor has standards, and you&rsquo;re going to face her in the elevator tomorrow.</p><p><em>Kehrwoche</em> is scarier than breaking the build on Friday afternoon. At least the build doesn&rsquo;t remember next Tuesday, and it won&rsquo;t give you that look in the hallway.</p><p>That dynamic should feel uncomfortably familiar to anyone who has worked on a software system longer than a few months.</p><h2 id="what-kehrwoche-really-means"><a href="/posts/kehrwoche-technical-debt/#what-kehrwoche-really-means" title="What Kehrwoche Really Means">What <em>Kehrwoche</em> Really Means</a></h2><p><em>Kehrwoche</em> isn&rsquo;t about cleanliness as an outcome. It&rsquo;s about preventing entropy from becoming visible.</p><p>No one expects perfection. Dust will return. Dirt is inevitable. The goal isn&rsquo;t to eliminate mess, but to ensure it never reaches a point where it disrupts daily life. Maintenance is continuous, not reactive.</p><p>This mindset is fundamentally different from how many software teams approach quality. In practice, teams often accept slow degradation until it becomes painful enough to justify a large intervention. <em>Kehrwoche</em> deliberately avoids that escalation by making small maintenance unavoidable and routine.</p><p>It&rsquo;s discipline by design, not by motivation.</p><h2 id="the-direct-translation-to-software-development"><a href="/posts/kehrwoche-technical-debt/#the-direct-translation-to-software-development" title="The Direct Translation to Software Development">The Direct Translation to Software Development</a></h2><p>Technical debt behaves exactly like dirt in shared spaces. Some of it is created intentionally. Some of it accumulates unintentionally. None of it disappears on its own.</p><p>The critical mistake many teams make is treating technical debt as an abstract future concern. It gets tracked in tickets, discussed in retrospectives, and postponed in planning meetings. Over time, it becomes normalized background noise.</p><p><em>Kehrwoche</em> doesn&rsquo;t allow for that kind of abstraction. Responsibility is assigned to people, not to the building. In software, responsibility often dissolves into process, tooling, or vague ownership models. When everyone owns the code, nobody cleans it.</p><p>I&rsquo;ve seen this pattern repeat itself across enterprise teams. Build times creep from five minutes to twenty. Test suites grow flaky. Configuration files accumulate &ldquo;temporary&rdquo; exceptions that live for years. Each change makes sense locally. The aggregate effect is paralysis.</p><h2 id="the-stairwell-problem-in-codebases"><a href="/posts/kehrwoche-technical-debt/#the-stairwell-problem-in-codebases" title="The Stairwell Problem in Codebases">The Stairwell Problem in Codebases</a></h2><p>Shared infrastructure is where technical debt becomes most toxic.</p><p>Build pipelines grow slower and more fragile. Configuration files accumulate exceptions. Authentication flows gain special cases that no one fully understands anymore. These aren&rsquo;t edge areas of the system. They&rsquo;re the paths every developer walks through daily.</p><p>Like a stairwell, these areas are rarely &ldquo;owned&rdquo; by a single team. They evolve through small, justified changes that make sense locally and degrade the global structure over time. No single change is catastrophic. The aggregate effect is.</p><p>Consider a CI/CD pipeline. Year one, it&rsquo;s ten lines of configuration: trigger on main branch, run the build. Clean. Obvious. Everyone understands it.</p><div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-yaml" data-lang="yaml"><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="nt">trigger</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="w">

Every comment explained the context. Nobody was careless.</p><p>But nobody was responsible for the aggregate state. The pipeline became the project&rsquo;s stairwell—walked through daily, maintained by nobody, degrading incrementally until simple changes became risky.</p><p>At that point, teams don&rsquo;t complain about dirt. They complain about friction, unpredictability, and fear of change. The dirt metaphor just becomes technical language.</p><h2 id="why-big-cleanups-fail-systematically"><a href="/posts/kehrwoche-technical-debt/#why-big-cleanups-fail-systematically" title="Why Big Cleanups Fail Systematically">Why Big Cleanups Fail Systematically</a></h2><p>The instinctive response to accumulated technical debt is the big cleanup. A refactoring initiative. A platform rewrite. A dedicated sprint to &ldquo;fix the foundation.&rdquo;</p><p>This approach fails for structural reasons. Maintenance requires context, and context decays quickly. The longer cleanup is delayed, the more expensive it becomes to understand what can be safely changed. Meanwhile, the product continues to evolve, reintroducing new debt in parallel.</p><p>I&rsquo;ve watched teams spend entire quarters on &ldquo;technical debt sprints&rdquo; only to see the same problems resurface within months. The work wasn&rsquo;t wrong. The timing was. By the time they got permission to clean up, they&rsquo;d lost the context needed to do it efficiently.</p><p><em>Kehrwoche</em> works precisely because it avoids this trap. The work is small enough to fit into normal life. It doesn&rsquo;t require special ceremonies, approvals, or justifications. It&rsquo;s simply part of living in the system.</p><p>Software maintenance should be treated the same way.</p><h2 id="the-boy-scout-rule-isnt-enough"><a href="/posts/kehrwoche-technical-debt/#the-boy-scout-rule-isnt-enough" title="The Boy Scout Rule Isn&rsquo;t Enough">The Boy Scout Rule Isn&rsquo;t Enough</a></h2><p>&ldquo;Leave the code better than you found it&rdquo; sounds like <em>Kehrwoche</em>. In practice, it rarely functions the same way.</p><p>The Boy Scout Rule depends on individual motivation and opportunity. It works when developers have the capacity to improve things proactively. It fails when teams are under pressure to ship features, when codebases are too complex to understand quickly, or when improvements require coordination across multiple teams.</p><p>More fundamentally, the Boy Scout Rule makes cleanup optional and contextual. You improve things when you happen to touch them. When you have time. When it seems safe. The decision happens at the worst possible moment—when you&rsquo;re already focused on something else.</p><p>I&rsquo;ve seen what this produces: teams that talk about code quality constantly but never improve it systematically. Developers who want to clean up but can&rsquo;t justify the time. Pull requests that get blocked because &ldquo;this change is out of scope.&rdquo; The Boy Scout Rule becomes aspirational rather than operational.</p><p>The problem isn&rsquo;t lack of goodwill. It&rsquo;s lack of structure. When cleanup depends on individual initiative, it competes with everything else. Feature delivery has deadlines. Bugs have severity. Technical debt has neither. It loses by default.</p><p><em>Kehrwoche</em> doesn&rsquo;t depend on motivation. It depends on assignment. You don&rsquo;t clean when you feel like it. You clean when it&rsquo;s your turn. That removes the decision-making burden and the social awkwardness of &ldquo;wasting time&rdquo; on cleanup. There&rsquo;s no debate about whether cleaning is valuable. There&rsquo;s only the question of whether you showed up for your assigned time.</p><p>A practical translation might look like this: Every team member gets assigned one week per quarter as their &ldquo;cleanup week.&rdquo; During that week, they spend their first hour each day working through a shared technical debt backlog. Not optional. Not negotiable. Just like <em>Kehrwoche</em>, everyone knows the rotation schedule. Everyone takes their turn. The rest of the team knows it&rsquo;s your week and adjusts expectations accordingly.</p><p>The items should be small enough to fit the time window. Simplify a confusing method name. Remove a dead code path. Update a misleading comment. Fix a flaky test. Add missing documentation to a cryptic function. Extract a reusable component from duplicated code. The goal isn&rsquo;t heroic refactoring. It&rsquo;s routine grooming.</p><p>This shifts the question from &ldquo;Should we clean up?&rdquo; to &ldquo;What do we clean up today?&rdquo; That subtle change in framing eliminates most of the friction. Cleanup stops being a negotiation and becomes a rhythm. And just like with stairwells, your teammates notice when it&rsquo;s your week. They&rsquo;ll mention if nothing improved. Not aggressively—just a casual observation that carries weight.</p><h2 id="humor-helps-but-culture-does-the-real-work"><a href="/posts/kehrwoche-technical-debt/#humor-helps-but-culture-does-the-real-work" title="Humor Helps, but Culture Does the Real Work">Humor Helps, but Culture Does the Real Work</a></h2><p>Swabians complain loudly about <em>Kehrwoche</em>. There are jokes, stereotypes, and endless exaggerations about perfectionist neighbors and impossibly high cleaning standards. None of that weakens the system. If anything, it reinforces it by making the obligation visible and shared. The complaining is part of the ritual, not resistance to it.</p><p>In software teams, humor around technical debt often serves the opposite function. It becomes a coping mechanism that replaces action. Legacy jokes turn into excuses. Irony becomes a substitute for responsibility.</p><p>I&rsquo;ve sat through retrospectives where teams laugh about the &ldquo;haunted module&rdquo; nobody dares to touch. Everyone agrees it&rsquo;s a problem. Everyone acknowledges someone should fix it. Then the meeting ends, and nothing changes. The joke releases tension without creating obligation.</p><p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll fix it in the next sprint&rdquo; becomes the technical debt equivalent of &ldquo;thoughts and prayers.&rdquo; It signals concern without committing action. The laughter acknowledges shared pain but doesn&rsquo;t demand shared responsibility.</p><p>The difference is structural. In Swabia, you can complain about <em>Kehrwoche</em> all you want. You still have to clean when it&rsquo;s your week. The humor doesn&rsquo;t grant an exemption. In software, humor often becomes the exemption itself. We laugh instead of fixing.</p><p>A healthy culture allows humor without letting it undermine discipline. Complaining is fine. Avoiding cleanup is not. The question is whether your jokes postpone work or acknowledge the work you&rsquo;re already doing.</p><h2 id="a-practical-takeaway"><a href="/posts/kehrwoche-technical-debt/#a-practical-takeaway" title="A Practical Takeaway">A Practical Takeaway</a></h2><p><em>Kehrwoche</em> scales because it&rsquo;s boring, predictable, and non-negotiable. It doesn&rsquo;t rely on heroics or passion. It relies on consistency and social expectation. That&rsquo;s the part most software teams get wrong. They wait for inspiration, alignment, or the perfect moment. None of those ever arrive.</p><p>Applied to software development, this means treating technical debt as a first-class operational concern. Cleanup must be small, frequent, and attached to real ownership. Not a future initiative. Not a side project. Not something that only happens when everything else is done.</p><p>Start with the rotation. Assign cleanup weeks to team members on a predictable schedule. Make it visible. Make it normal. Make it expected. When it&rsquo;s your week, you clean. When it&rsquo;s not, you respect that someone else is handling the work you&rsquo;ll do next quarter.</p><p>The work itself should be unglamorous. If it feels heroic, you&rsquo;ve waited too long. Simplify method names. Remove dead imports. Fix misleading comments. Update outdated documentation. Delete code paths nobody uses anymore. These aren&rsquo;t the changes that go in blog posts. They&rsquo;re the changes that keep the system navigable.</p><p>Clean systems aren&rsquo;t the result of exceptional engineers. They&rsquo;re the result of ordinary engineers doing unglamorous work regularly. That&rsquo;s the uncomfortable truth <em>Kehrwoche</em> makes unavoidable.</p><p>In Swabia, that work involves a broom.</p><p>In software, it involves discipline, restraint, and the willingness to clean up after yourself before someone else has to.</p><p>The stairwell is shared. Everyone walks through it. Everyone keeps it clean. Your turn comes around whether you like it or not. The only question is whether you&rsquo;ll show up.</p><p>And if you need a place to start sweeping—that <em>4,000-line</em> <code>Utils.cs</code> file everyone&rsquo;s afraid to touch is basically the digital equivalent of a stairwell that hasn&rsquo;t seen a broom in three years. Mrs. Schmid would be <strong>disappointed</strong>.</p></section><section class="giscus"><h2>Comments</h2><aside class="giscus" id="giscus-thread" role="region" aria-label="Comments"></aside></section><script src="https://giscus.app/client.js" data-repo="dailydevops/dailydevops.github.io" data-repo-id="R_kgDOHA8eFg" data-category="Announcements" data-category-id="DIC_kwDOHA8eFs4COIqL" data-mapping="pathname" data-strict="1" data-reactions-enabled="0" data-emit-metadata="0" data-input-position="bottom" data-theme="light" data-lang="en" crossorigin="anonymous" async></script></article><aside class="sidebar divider"><section class="sidecar info" aria-labelledby="info-heading"><header><h2 id="info-heading" class="sr-only">Informations</h2></header><ul role="list"><li role="listitem"><time datetime="2026-01-09T11:00:00+01:00" itemprop="datePublished">Published on 1/9/26 11:00 am</time></li><li>Read in 9 minutes</li></ul></section><section class="sidecar author" aria-labelledby="author-martin-st%C3%BChmer"><header><h2 id="author-martin-st%C3%BChmer"><a href="/authors/martin/" rel="author" title="Martin Stühmer" itemprop="url">Author <span itemprop="name">Martin Stühmer</span></a></h2></header><figure class="round"><picture><img src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/6da4a47ff9cc2b750452225fdb2582f7?d=identicon&amp;s=200" alt="Martin Stühmer" loading="lazy" decoding="async" title="Martin Stühmer"></picture></figure><section class="content" itemprop="description">Martin is a software architect and developer who has spent nearly two decades navigating the .NET ecosystem from Framework 2.0 to modern .NET 10.

GitHub Copilot autocompletes entire functions. ChatGPT builds APIs from prompts. Typing is dead. So why will real professionals never be replaced? Because <strong>&ldquo;vibe coding&rdquo;</strong>—describe what you want, ship what AI generates—is a productivity illusion that collapses spectacularly in production. When code generation becomes trivial, understanding what that code costs, where it fails, why it breaks under load becomes everything. AI generates syntax. Professionals understand execution, failure modes, operational cost, and production consequences. The differentiator isn&rsquo;t typing speed—it&rsquo;s mastering <strong>the feedback loop</strong>: write code, watch it fail, understand why, refine thinking. This discipline can&rsquo;t be automated. Prompt engineers generate code. Real professionals ensure it survives contact with reality.</section></article><article class="post"><figure class="square"><picture><source srcset="/images/technical-debt-80x80.webp?v=d4b6750fc74794c27703f1eaa447efe7" type="image/webp"><source srcset="/images/technical-debt-80x80.png?v=89bb5046cc0b986270c06c1c4de9e797" type="image/png"><img src="/images/technical-debt.png?v=67ddb8f47e467b6ae8d570696cc5f79d" alt="Clean Code: A Lip Service, Not a Standard
